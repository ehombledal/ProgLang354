Description and Comments:

Overall, Part1 was very difficult in the beginning as I did not understand fully how Haskell worked. Despite the lectures, it took me actually sitting down and going to office hours to understand why Haskell worked the way it did, particularly when it came to typecasting and type matching. However, once I understood that and got a few of the basic functions down, it was easy to see how all of the functions worked together and built off each other. I think this assignment was very helpful in giving me a solid understanding of what Haskell is capable of, and how to best make use of typing. 

Part2, however, came a lot more naturally to me. It was very interesting seeing how you can generate your own parser and have it work and accept commands you input. Other than some issues with syntax, this part of the assignment was much easier.
