Description of Accomplishments: 
Trenton and I worked individually for parts 1 and 2, and worked together for part 3. 

Difficulties: 
Overall, I had a very hard time actually understanding why we were doing what we were doing in the beginning of the assignment. 
Particularly with things like evalCBN, or just the general flow of how we were supposed to develop functions in LC, I really struggled. 
Thankfully, Trenton was able to help me understand a lot of the functions and why we were making the functions we were. 
As well, building the functions in Haskell first made it actually crystal clear what we were doing, it only is unfortunate it took me that long to actually figure it out!
              
Testing the Program: 
Followed the instructions provided in the assignment, with generating the parser and interpretter, building it, and then calling the test programs with stack exec

What I Learned:
The main thing I learned is that building a programming language is incredibly hard. From handling types, to parsers and interpretters, it is very difficult for 
me to wrap my head around conceptually. However, this assignment really helped me understand what goes into creating a programming language, and what the "pieces" 
needed actually are, and what they do. Overall I found the parser much more simple to understand than the interpreter, and still do not fully, fully understand all
that goes into making it work. As well, this assignment actually helped me a good bit with wrapping my head around functional programming, as Part 3's section of writing
in both LC and Haskell side by side helped me understand conceptually what we want functional programming to do. 

Interesting Observations: 
Looking back I think having a lot of the assignment handed to us by you both helped and hurt a little bit. I think having it explained is one thing, but without 
actually building evalCBN or a lot of the "under the hood" parts of the assignment made it difficult to understand in the beginning. As I mentioned previously
it wasn't until almost the end of the assignment that I actually saw what we were building and why. However, I understand a lot of the nitty gritty is outside the scope of the course, so I don't actually know how I would fix this issue I had.

Conclusions: 
All in all, I think this was a very helpful, albeit difficult, assignment to do. Without going to office hours for almost every session, I do not know how I would have managed to finish this.
