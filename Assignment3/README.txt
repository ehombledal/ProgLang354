Description of Accomplishments: 
Trenton and I worked together for parts 1 and 2.  

Difficulties: 
Overall, this assignment was easier than the one in Assignment 2. I do not know if it was because it was an interpretive language, but it just seemed to click a lot easier.
The only real difficulty I had was understanding the syntax in the beginning, but the Part 1 of the assignment helped with that a lot. 
              
Testing the Program: 
Followed the instructions provided in the assignment for testing, in addition to creating some of our own cases in Round Robin. 

What I Learned:
It was very interesting learning how you can essentially force a functional programming language to be an iterative one, should you need it to be. Even though it is a lot of work under the hood, 
it works just as well as any other iterative language out there. As well, it was very interesting seeing how all of the different data structures could be implemented in Haskell, even ones that I did not think would work, like lists.

Interesting Observations: 
I think it would be fun to run this against a language that has natural, built in lists as part of its syntax, like C++. I wonder if the additional work done in Haskell would be enough to make it slower than C++?
Otherwise, I think the assignment was quite simple to wrap my head around, especially with the addition of the help command and all of your written instructions. 

Conclusions: 
All in all, I think this was a very educational assignment to do. Much easier to understand than the last one, at the very least!
